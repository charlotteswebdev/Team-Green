            <h2>About The Green Meal App</h2>
            <p>  Welcome to <b> The Green Meal! 🌿🍵💚🌱 </b> <br>
                We are a non-profit organisation, committed to tackling the current cost of living crisis in the UK. In January 2023, <b>9.3 million adults</b>  experienced food insecurity. That's <b>17.7% of households</b> in the UK! <br>
                Our platform supports those in need of food, by locating their nearest food bank and allowing users to donate surplus food, making our mission a community-driven initiative. We also have a recipe generator feature that provides healthy and cost-effective meals. <br>
                We are passionate that <b>food should be accessible to all</b>, people shouldn't have to go without meals now that a weekly grocery shop has increased by a whopping 19%. 
                To a greener, healthier future. We hope you will join 🟢 the movement. #teamgreen
